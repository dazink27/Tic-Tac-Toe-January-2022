# for this assignment, I think I will split this program into three different groups 
# One thru three, two thru six, and six thru nine.
# First, I will ask the user to give me a number, then assign that number to a function acording to their input.  

What I need to do is run a for loop through each row.  the for loop will check for variables and replace a variable with X?
